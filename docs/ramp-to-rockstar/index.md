# 🧨 Ramp to Rockstar  
**Onboarding that Actually Works**  
*From Day One to Demo Hero — in record time, and without the yawns.*

## 🎯 What We Tackled

✅ Scalable onboarding bootcamps that *actually shortened ramp*  
✅ Manager development tracks that *built retention-ready leaders*  
✅ AI-powered microlearning tools that boosted engagement (without becoming another tab to ignore)

## 🛠️ Systems I Built

**Ready-for-Anything Bootcamps**

- Live labs by Week 2  
- Manager dashboards tracking learner momentum  

**Manager Lift-Off Kits**  
- Competency models + coaching playbooks  
- 360-feedback + AI-powered convos  
- Leadership sidekick bot (mockup!)

**Digital Training Stack**
